friend function:
It is a special type of function which is declared within a class defined outside the class. 

We use `friend` as a keyword before its prototype. 

It is defined independently outside the class. 

Access private, protected, and public data of a class like a member. 

One should remember that to a friend you will send an object and then it can access. Direct access not possible 

A friend can be a friend of multiple classes, allowing inter-class calculation and communication.
