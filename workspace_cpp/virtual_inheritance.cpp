
/*The famous diamond problem is a problem when a single grandparent is inherited by two classes and further these two classes create one subclass. 
It's a classic example of multi-level inheritance taking place with multiple inheritance. 
In normal cases activation of a child wi-ll activate both the parent and also from each parent twice the grandparent class. 
In order to stop this we can use something called a virtual base class. 
Simple. Using `virtual` as a keyword in inheritance will allow only one activation to the grandparent class, coming from the first inherited class only.
