/*
What is ambiguity? It is Confusion of a derived or 
subclass where both the parents are giving an exact 
method to inherit and we are unclear whose method to inherit 

The way C++ resolves ambiguity is 
Subclass or the child class will write its own method and, within the method, 
would decide whose method from the parent it has to inherit. 

In C++ we can also override, that is, write our own new method, which will reject the parent's method. 
In C++ we can also activate both parents' methods by precisely writing them within a newly created method. 
In C++ we can also decide which method I want to take, only writing that method within a newly created 

important interview question: why cpp handle multiple inhertance and why not java?
